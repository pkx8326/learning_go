# Go Learning

##### NOTE:
This repository is similar to the repository I'm documenting [my C/C++ learning](https://github.com/pkx8326/learning_C_and_C_plus_plus). So, I'll just copy and paste most of the readme content from there as the following:

### About this repository
I'm documenting my Go learning journey in this repository. It is made public so that it may also be of help to those learning the language just like myself.

### Learning materials
I started learning the language from ["Go - The Complete Guide"](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-guide/), an online course on [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/). There will be more learning materials from other places as I progress, and I'll list each of them [here]().

### Repository structure
Each Go project, no matter how small it is, has its own folder and its own README.md file in its respective folder. This is my way of journaling my learning, and it should also be benificial to whoever learning the language comming across this repository.

### What to do next?
If possible, let's enjoy the learning journey together. Peace!
